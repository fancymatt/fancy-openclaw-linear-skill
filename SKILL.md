# Linear CLI Quick Reference

## Token Location (Single Source of Truth)

Linear OAuth tokens live in **one place only**:

```
~/.openclaw/workspace/{agentId}/.secrets/linear.env
```

Exception: the **main** agent has no subdirectory — its token lives at `~/.openclaw/workspace/.secrets/linear.env`. (The `getLinearSecretPath()` helper handles this special case automatically; never compute the path inline.)

Each agent has its own unique token. Tokens must **never** be shared between agents.

The CLI resolves the agent name from `OPENCLAW_MCP_AGENT_ID` or `OPENCLAW_AGENT_NAME` env vars, then loads `LINEAR_OAUTH_TOKEN` from that canonical path.

**When rotating tokens:** update only the file at `~/.openclaw/workspace/{agentId}/.secrets/linear.env` (or `~/.openclaw/workspace/.secrets/linear.env` for main). Do **not** create or update files in `~/.openclaw/workspace-{agentId}/` — those are vestigial profile workspaces and should not contain secrets.

Use `linear doctor` to verify token validity and identity.

## Debugging

- Add `--debug` to any command to dump raw GraphQL errors to stderr when something fails. Useful for diagnosing opaque validation errors.
- Common validation errors and their workarounds:
  - **Self-reference in comment body** → bare ticket ID detected; use em-dashes (—) or spell out the ID
  - **Comment too long** → exceeds max length; split into multiple comments or shorten
  - **Team/label mismatch** → label from wrong team; use a label from the issue's team
  - **Generic Argument Validation Error** → re-run with `--debug` to inspect which field failed

## Core Semantics — Know These

### Assignee vs Delegate
- **Assignee** = human who must act next. Set automatically by `needsHuman` and `complete`. Cleared when an agent takes ownership.
- **Delegate** = agent who owns the ticket. Set by `considerWork` (self) and `handoffWork`/`refuseWork` (another agent). Cleared by `complete` and `needsHuman`.
- **The key insight:** assignee is ONLY set when a human needs to do something. This makes "assigned to me" views in Linear reliable — every ticket there is genuinely waiting on human input.

### Semantic Commands (Agent Standard)

These are the ONLY commands agents should use for workflow state transitions. Every command captures intent and handles multiple API calls atomically.

#### Read Commands

```
linear observe-issue <ID>             # Read issue + last 10 comments (no ownership change)
linear observe-issue <ID> --all       # Read issue + ALL comments
linear observe-issue <ID> --human     # Chronological timeline: creation +
                                      #   comments + state/delegate/assignee/
                                      #   priority change events, each with
                                      #   ISO and relative timestamp.
```

JSON output has `comments[]` and `history[]` sorted ascending by `createdAt` — agents can read sequentially without re-sorting.

Use `observe-issue` when you are @mentioned (not delegated) or doing a board sweep. No state changes.

#### Write Commands

```
linear consider-work <ID>             # Accept delegation: set delegate=self, status=Thinking, clear assignee; rejects Backlog; no-op on Done/Canceled
linear consider-work <ID> --force     # Explicitly override Backlog gate or reopen Done/Canceled issues with a warning
                                      # Returns issue context + last 10 comments
linear begin-work <ID>                # Start active work: status=Doing (idempotent)
linear refuse-work <ID> <agent>       # Decline: status=Todo, delegate to another agent (requires --comment)
linear handoff-work <ID> <agent>      # Hand off: status=Todo, delegate to agent (requires --comment)
linear complete <ID>                  # Finish: status=Done, clear delegate + assignee (optional --comment)
linear needs-human <ID> <human>       # Escalate: status=Todo, assignee=human, clear delegate (requires --comment)
linear park <ID>                      # Deprioritize: status=Backlog, clear delegate + assignee (optional --comment)
linear manage <ID>                    # Take stewardship: status=Managing, delegate=self, clear assignee (optional --comment)
linear manage <ID> --interval 2h      # Same, but set per-ticket wake cadence (m/h/d). Default cadence is 30m.
linear note <ID> --comment "<msg>"    # Post comment only: no state, delegate, or assignee change
                                      # Works on any status (including Done/Canceled)
```

> **Note:** camelCase aliases (`considerWork`, `beginWork`, etc.) still work for backward compatibility but kebab-case is the standard.


### Inline Comment Safety — use `--comment-file` for Markdown/code

Never pass comment bodies containing backticks, code spans, file paths in backticks, fenced code, or non-trivial Markdown via inline `--comment`. Inline comments are parsed by the shell before `linear` receives them, so backticks can be treated as command substitution and silently stripped.

Repro:

```bash
$ echo "removed `personal/expense-tally.md` from the vault"
removed  from the vault
```

Rule: if a Linear comment contains backticks, code, paths, Markdown formatting, multiple paragraphs, or anything you would be sad to see corrupted, write it to a temp file and use `--comment-file <path>`. This applies to `note`, `refuse-work`, `needs-human`, `handoff-work`, and `complete`.

Safe pattern:

```bash
cat > /tmp/linear-comment.md <<'EOF'
Removed `personal/expense-tally.md` from the vault.
EOF
linear handoff-work AI-123 "Charles (CTO)" --comment-file /tmp/linear-comment.md
```

#### Comment Options

All write commands accept `--comment "<msg>"` or `--comment-file <path>` for comments. `refuse-work`, `handoff-work`, and `needs-human` accept an optional comment — if omitted, the command still succeeds but emits a soft stderr warning. `consider-work` and `begin-work` do not accept comments — agents should not comment without a handoff.

> **One comment per turn, maximum.** If you have already posted a substantive comment in the current turn (via `note`, a prior `handoff-work`, etc.), do NOT post a second comment that summarizes or references the first. The comment IS the output. Never follow a substantive comment with a meta-comment like "Analysis posted — see above" or "Investigation complete — handing back for review." If you used `linear note` to post your analysis and now need to hand off, use the handoff command's `--comment` to add only what's genuinely new — or if the note already says everything, keep the handoff comment minimal (one sentence max).

### When to Use Each Command

| Situation | Command |
|---|---|
| You receive a webhook delegation | `consider-work <ID>` |
| You are @mentioned but not delegated | `observe-issue <ID>` |
| You start actively coding/researching | `begin-work <ID>` |
| You're done and passing to another agent | `handoff-work <ID> <agent> --comment "..."` |
| You're done and the ticket is complete | `complete <ID>` |
| You need a human decision/input | `needs-human <ID> <human> --comment "..."` |
| You're the wrong person for this task | `refuse-work <ID> <agent> --comment "..."` |
| Intentionally deprioritizing / parking a ticket | `park <ID>` |
| Owning a parent / externally-blocked ticket (stewardship) | `manage <ID>` |
| Browsing tickets without ownership | `observe-issue <ID>` |
| Adding context to a closed ticket | `note <ID> --comment "..."` |

### Workflow Rules (from AGENTS.md)

1. **All communication goes in the ticket.** Post analysis, findings, updates, deliverables as comments via `--comment` on semantic commands.
2. **Always hand off when your work is done.** Use `handoff-work`, `complete`, or `needs-human`. Never leave a ticket delegated to yourself after completing work.
3. **If it's not your area, give your perspective and delegate back.** Use `handoff-work` or `refuse-work`.
4. **Structural issues get their own tickets.** Don't bury observations as footnotes.
5. **Move tickets forward immediately.** New tickets → delegate to appropriate agent via the semantic commands.
6. **One comment per turn, maximum.** Never post a second comment in the same turn that summarizes or references a comment you just posted. The "Assessment posted — see above" pattern is noise. Pick the right command and put everything in its `--comment`. If the handoff command forces a `--comment` but you already said everything in a `note`, write one sentence max on the handoff comment (e.g., "See prior comment for full analysis.") — don't repeat yourself.

### Closing Rules — Non-Negotiable

6. **The agent who does the work cannot close the ticket.** `complete` must only be called by a reviewer — never by the agent who implemented the work. Once you've done the work, use `handoffWork` or `needsHuman` to pass it to a reviewer. The reviewer calls `complete`.
7. **Do not close a ticket with open flagged issues.** If a reviewer raised an issue in a comment, it must be resolved in one of three ways before `complete` is called:
   - A new ticket was created to track it, OR
   - The original poster confirmed it can be ignored, OR
   - The fix was implemented and confirmed.
   Silence is not resolution. A flagged issue with no explicit response blocks `complete`.

### Managing — Stewardship State

`Managing` is for tickets you own but cannot push forward right now: parent
tickets whose work lives in children, tickets blocked on external state
(deploy, CI, third-party reply), or staged dependencies (B depends on A). It
sits outside `linear queue` / `--next` so it never competes with directly
executable work, but the Linear Connector wakes you on a cadence to re-review.

**Default cadence:** 30 minutes per ticket. Override per-ticket by adding a
line to the description (the `manage` command can write this for you):

```
Managing-interval: 2h
```

Accepted units: `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`. Bare numbers default to minutes.

**Stewardship checklist** (what to do when the connector wakes you):

1. Check subtask state. If a child resolved since your last review, decide
   whether the parent moves forward.
2. Look for stalled children — anything in Backlog that should be To Do?
   Anything assigned to the wrong person?
3. Verify assignee + delegate on each child match the current owner.
4. If something material changed, post a one-line note on the parent.
5. If nothing changed and the situation is genuinely the same, no comment.

Move tickets out of Managing when they're complete (`complete`), abandoned
(`needs-human` / `refuse-work`), or actively workable (`begin-work`). Do not
let Managing become a graveyard.

### Comment Verification

**Never read-after-write to verify a comment.** The mutation result is the strongly-consistent source of truth. Trust the `commentId` and `commentUrl` printed on success. If you genuinely need to confirm propagation (rare), use `linear verify-comment <commentId>` — it uses the strongly-consistent node query, not the eventually-consistent connection feed. The `linear comments` / `observe-issue` connection feed can lag by seconds to minutes.

### Deprecated Commands (Human Use Only)

The following commands still work but print deprecation warnings for agents:
- `linear status`, `linear assign`, `linear delegate`, `linear handoff`, `linear comment`

Agents should NOT use these. They bypass the semantic intent model and cause delegate/assignee drift. Use semantic commands instead.

```

## Creating Issues in the Right Project

Agents often get this wrong, so treat project selection as part of the create operation — not a cleanup step.

### Required create workflow

1. If the user names a project/workspace/initiative, resolve it first:
   ```bash
   linear projects
   ```
2. Use the exact project name or, safer, the project UUID from `linear projects`.
3. Run a dry run before creating when project placement matters:
   ```bash
   linear create <TEAM> "<title>" --project <project-id-or-exact-name> --dry-run
   ```
4. Confirm the dry-run payload has the intended `teamId`/team key and `projectId`/project name.
5. Only then create the issue with the same `--project` value.

### When project is ambiguous

- If the user says a project name that matches multiple things or could mean team vs project, ask one clarifying question.
- If the user says “in the Linear Connector space/project”, search `linear projects` and use the exact Linear Connector project ID/name, not the AI Systems team default.
- If no project is specified, it is okay to create team-only — but do not invent a project.

### Safer pattern

```bash
linear projects > /tmp/linear-projects.json
# choose the exact project id/name from the list
linear create AI "Title" --project "<project-id>" --description-file /tmp/desc.md --delegate "Charles" --dry-run
linear create AI "Title" --project "<project-id>" --description-file /tmp/desc.md --delegate "Charles"
```

Prefer project IDs over names when available; names are easier for humans but IDs avoid ambiguity and stale memory.

## Ticket State on Creation

**Rule: actionable tickets go to To Do, not Backlog.**

- `linear create` defaults to To Do (Linear's API default). This is correct — do not override it with `--state backlog` for work that is ready to be picked up.
- **Backlog is for intentional parking only**: non-milestone project ideas, waiting-on-something items, deprioritized work that Matt has explicitly asked to defer.
- The Linear connector skips Backlog wake-ups. A ticket with a delegate in Backlog will never be auto-dispatched — it silently sits until a human manually flips it.
- If you create a ticket with `--state backlog` AND `--assignee` or `--delegate`, the CLI will warn you. Fix it by using `--state todo` instead.

| Situation | Correct state |
|---|---|
| Ticket is ready for implementation, has a delegate | To Do (default) |
| Ticket is a future idea not yet scoped | Backlog |
| Matt says "put this in the backlog" | Backlog (and remove from milestone) |
| Sub-task spawned during active sprint | To Do |
